# Landing Page Learnings

Insights from building and testing 3 consulting landing pages through 2 generations of evolution.

## What Worked

### 1. Time Commitment Clarity Is Everything
The single biggest unlock was explicitly stating "Your total time: ~3 hours" and similar specifics. Founders' #1 objection isn't price — it's "I don't have time to onboard someone."

**Implementation:** Added dedicated "What this requires from you" sections with specific hour counts.

### 2. Industry-Specific Proof Converts Skeptics
Generic claims like "I've helped companies" don't land. Mini case studies with industry variety (SaaS, DTC, professional services) made skeptical buyers feel seen.

**Implementation:** Added 3 mini case studies to Ops Audit page, "Who this works for" section on Agency page.

### 3. Scarcity Without Desperation
"Taking 2 audits this quarter" signals quality (limited capacity) and creates urgency without feeling salesy. Much better than fake countdown timers.

**Implementation:** Added capacity limits to hero sections and CTAs on all pages.

### 4. Address the Fear Directly
For agency founders: "Won't this make us feel corporate?" For dev shops: "Won't this kill agility?" Calling out the fear and directly addressing it builds trust.

**Implementation:** Added dedicated sections that name the fear and reframe it.

### 5. FAQ as Objection Handling
Preemptively answering top objections (industry fit, team resistance, scope clarity) in FAQ format feels helpful rather than defensive.

**Implementation:** Added FAQ sections to all pages addressing 3-4 top objections each.

### 6. "Embedded" Needs Definition
For fractional ops, the word "embedded" was too vague. Clarifying it (in Slack, weekly syncs, tool access) removed ambiguity.

**Implementation:** Added "What 'embedded' actually looks like" section with specific touchpoints.

## What Didn't Work (Gen 0 Weaknesses)

### 1. Assuming Industry Credibility
The agency page had instant credibility (Sebastian runs an agency). Ops Audit and Fractional pages didn't — they needed industry-specific proof added.

### 2. Vague Time Expectations
"2-week audit" means nothing if the founder doesn't know how much of THEIR time it takes. Gen 0 left this completely unclear.

### 3. Urgency as Afterthought
Gen 0 had no urgency elements. "Book a call" with no scarcity = "I'll do it someday" = never.

### 4. Monolithic Proof Section
One big testimonial/proof block is skimmable. Breaking into multiple mini case studies performed better.

## Direct Response Principles Applied

### From Eugene Schwartz
- **Awareness Level Matching:** These pages target Problem Aware → Solution Aware prospects. Led with pain, not solution. Headlines ask questions that resonate with the problem.

### From Robert Collier
- **Enter the Conversation:** "Do you know where your biggest operational bottleneck is?" enters the exact mental dialogue the founder is having.

### From Dan Kennedy
- **Always Include Deadline:** Capacity limits create natural urgency
- **Clear CTA:** "Book a 20-minute call" — specific, low commitment

### From Gary Halbert
- **Specificity Sells:** "$40k/year in savings" beats "significant savings"
- **One Reader at a Time:** Written to one founder, not "founders"

## Page-Specific Notes

### Ops Audit
- Strongest hook: "Do you know where your biggest operational bottleneck is?"
- Key unlock: Mini case studies with industry variety
- Remaining opportunity: More SaaS-specific proof

### Fractional Ops
- Strongest hook: "How many hours per week on operations you shouldn't be doing?"
- Key unlock: "What embedded actually looks like" section
- The Month 1/2/3+ breakdown is extremely clear

### Agency Overhaul
- Strongest hook: "Your agency is busy. But is it profitable?"
- Key unlock: "Won't make you corporate" section
- Peer-to-peer angle (fellow agency owner) is the biggest credibility driver

## For Future Iterations

1. **Add founder photo** — Human connection increases trust
2. **Payment terms** — Agency page could mention flexibility for cash flow
3. **Video testimonials** — When available, add to proof sections
4. **A/B test headlines** — "Do you know..." vs "The $50k you're losing..."
5. **Add social proof numbers** — "Helped X founders" when data exists

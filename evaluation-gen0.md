Virtual ICP testing of the initial landing pages. Each page evaluated by 2 ICPs.

## 1. Ops Audit Page (`ops-audit.html`)

### Tester: Marcus Chen (Scaling SaaS Founder)
**Profile:** Co-founder & CEO, B2B SaaS, 18 employees, $1.5M ARR

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 8/10
- Believability: 7/10
- Urgency: 6/10
- Would I book a call? **Maybe**

**What resonated:**
- "Do you know where your biggest operational bottleneck is?" — YES. This is exactly my situation.
- The specific numbers ($40k/year, 8 hrs/week) are credible
- "Not a 50-page deck that collects dust" — I've been burned by this
- The guarantee about implementing 3 recommendations is smart

**What questions remain:**
- What's his experience with SaaS specifically? Agency experience is different
- What does the 2-week process actually look like? How much of my/my team's time?
- Are those results ($40k, 8hrs) from companies like mine or different industries?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "$10k is real money for us. How do I justify this to my co-founder?"
- "No one understands our business well enough to help" — page doesn't address this
- Time commitment unclear — "I don't have time to onboard someone"

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If I googled and found no other proof points
- If the Calendly was for a 45-minute "discovery call" (feels salesy)
- If he seemed like a pure consultant, not an operator

**Suggestions:**
- Add a case study or mini-example from a SaaS/tech company
- Be more specific about time commitment from the founder
- Add "taking X clients this quarter" for urgency

### Tester: Diana Rodriguez (E-Commerce Operator)
**Profile:** Founder & CEO, DTC skincare, 28 employees, $4M revenue

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 7/10
- Believability: 6/10
- Urgency: 5/10
- Would I book a call? **No, not yet**

**What resonated:**
- Pain points are accurate — tools not talking, nobody owning ops
- Specific outcomes are good
- The guarantee is reassuring

**What questions remain:**
- Does he understand e-commerce/DTC? Agency background doesn't immediately translate
- My issues are fulfillment, inventory, CS — will he catch those in 2 weeks?
- What does "30 days of follow-up support" actually mean?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "My business is different" — no e-commerce proof points
- "I need someone who'll actually DO things, not just tell me" — audit is still just recommendations
- Margin/efficiency language would resonate more than "bottlenecks"

**What would make me NOT book:**
- No industry-specific credibility
- Feels like he's looking for any founder, not specifically someone like me
- "Quick wins visible in weeks, not months" — not promised here

**Suggestions:**
- Add industry-specific examples or state which industries he's worked with
- Emphasize quick wins / speed to value
- Consider margin/profitability language instead of just "bottlenecks"

## 2. Fractional Ops Page (`fractional-ops.html`)

### Tester: Jason Park (Series A SaaS Founder)
**Profile:** CEO, B2B SaaS, 45 employees, $4M ARR, just raised $8M Series A

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 9/10
- Believability: 8/10
- Urgency: 7/10
- Would I book a call? **Yes**

**What resonated:**
- "How many hours per week on operations you shouldn't be doing?" — instantly hooked
- Month 1/2/3+ breakdown is crystal clear
- "You don't manage me" — this is huge. I don't have capacity to manage another person
- The bridge role section addresses my "should I hire?" anxiety
- 15 hours → 2 hours case study is specific and believable

**What questions remain:**
- What exactly does "embedded" mean? Are you in our Slack? Weekly meetings?
- What happens if I want to hire full-time ops in month 6?
- Can you share more about the 40-person Series A company?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "$6k/month adds up — that's $72k/year. At what point should I just hire?"
- "We move fast — can you keep up with startup chaos?"
- What's your capacity? Are you doing this for 10 companies simultaneously?

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If the 20-minute call turned into a 45-minute pitch
- If there's no clear deliverable after Month 1
- If I found out he's juggling too many clients

**Suggestions:**
- Add something about startup pace / agility
- Clarify what "embedded" looks like practically
- Address the "when to transition to full-time hire" question more directly
- Add urgency — "taking X clients this quarter"

### Tester: Priya Sharma (Overwhelmed Consumer Tech Founder)
**Profile:** Co-founder & CEO, Consumer subscription app, 32 employees, $3M ARR

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 8/10
- Believability: 7/10
- Urgency: 6/10
- Would I book a call? **Maybe**

**What resonated:**
- "I became a founder to build product, not chase invoices" — EXACTLY
- "You don't manage me" — I cannot take on more management
- The bridge role for figuring out what ops should look like
- Month-to-month after 3 months is flexible

**What questions remain:**
- Does he understand consumer/mobile/subscription? Agency feels B2B
- What's included in the $5-8k? How many hours? What scope?
- How do we communicate? Async? Meetings?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "We have unique challenges (consumer, subscription, mobile-first)" — no consumer proof
- "What even IS ops? Everyone defines it differently" — could be clearer about scope
- The "first 30 days" commitment is mentioned but feels buried

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If he seems like he only does B2B / enterprise
- If I have to explain too much context in our first call
- If the scope seems too broad / unclear

**Suggestions:**
- Add consumer tech or subscription business examples if possible
- Be more specific about what "ops" includes and excludes
- The 30-day commitment should be more prominent
- Address communication style (async-first? etc.)

## 3. Agency Ops Overhaul Page (`agency-overhaul.html`)

### Tester: Alex Thompson (Creative Agency Founder)
**Profile:** Founder & Creative Director, Brand/design agency, 14 employees, $1.8M revenue

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 9/10
- Believability: 9/10
- Urgency: 7/10
- Would I book a call? **Yes**

**What resonated:**
- "Your agency is busy. But is it profitable?" — ouch, but accurate
- "I make more money working alone" — I've literally thought this
- Fellow agency owner angle is HUGE — finally someone who gets it
- 40% → 74% profitability is very specific and compelling
- Tool fatigue section — I've tried 4 PM tools too
- "The tool was never the problem. The system was." — lightbulb moment

**What questions remain:**
- His agency does design & dev — will this work for a branding/strategy shop?
- What does the 90 days actually look like? How much of my time?
- Do I need to pause client work during this?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "Consultants don't understand creative work" — addressed somewhat but could be stronger
- "We're boutique, process will make us feel corporate" — not directly addressed
- "$20k is a lot for an agency our size" — ROI is mentioned but could be stronger

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If it felt like cookie-cutter consulting
- If he pushed a specific tool stack on me
- If the guarantee felt like weasel words

**Suggestions:**
- Add explicit "this won't kill your creativity" messaging
- Be more specific about time commitment during the 90 days
- The guarantee is good but could emphasize "10 percentage points" more
- Add a line about working with different agency types (not just dev)

### Tester: Nina Kowalski (Dev Shop Founder)
**Profile:** Founder & CEO, Software development agency, 22 employees, $2.8M revenue

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 9/10
- Believability: 8/10
- Urgency: 7/10
- Would I book a call? **Yes**

**What resonated:**
- MING Labs is a dev shop — he gets our world
- "Worried systematizing will kill your agility?" — you're reading my mind
- "Scoping frameworks that account for change" — this is the holy grail
- Estimation models based on actual data — I need this desperately
- 40% → 15% projects over budget is exactly what I want

**What questions remain:**
- What tools/systems does he actually use? I want to know specifics
- How does this work with our existing PM tool?
- Can we see examples of the estimation frameworks?

**What objections aren't handled:**
- "You're going to tell me to use Jira better" — addressed via tool fatigue section
- "Our projects are complex — cookie-cutter won't work" — could be stronger
- "$20k when margins are tight" — ROI case is there but I want more proof

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If the systems felt too rigid for iterative development
- If he couldn't speak to software development specifically
- If I sensed he'd fight our existing ways of working rather than enhance them

**Suggestions:**
- Maybe add a brief mention of what tools you use (without being prescriptive)
- Add more proof points — even anonymized case studies
- Could mention team size compatibility (works for 10-50 person agencies?)
- The dev-specific section is great — could even be more prominent

## Key Themes for Gen 1 Evolution

### Top Objections to Address:
1. **Industry fit** — "Does this work for MY specific industry/business type?"
2. **Time commitment** — How much founder/team time is required?
3. **Urgency** — Why should I act NOW vs. next quarter?
4. **Specificity of proof** — More case studies, more detail

### Weakest Sections:
1. **Ops Audit** — Industry credibility, urgency
2. **Fractional Ops** — Scope clarity, startup pace, capacity
3. **Agency Overhaul** — "Won't kill creativity" messaging, complexity handling

### What's Working Well:
1. Peer-to-peer tone (especially Agency Overhaul)
2. Specific numbers and outcomes
3. Guarantees are resonating
4. MING Labs credibility anchor
5. Problem/pain sections are accurate

### Improvements for Gen 1:
1. Add urgency elements (limited spots, timing)
2. Be more explicit about time commitment
3. Add industry/use case variety to proof
4. Address "won't make us corporate/rigid" for agency page
5. Clarify scope and communication expectations for fractional
6. Strengthen the "book a call" CTA with lower commitment framing

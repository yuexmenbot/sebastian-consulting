## 1. Ops Audit Page (Gen 1)

### Tester: Marcus Chen (Scaling SaaS Founder)

**Scores:**
- Clarity: 9/10 (was 8)
- Believability: 8/10 (was 7)
- Urgency: 8/10 (was 6)
- Would I book a call? **Yes** (was Maybe)

**What improved:**
- "Taking 2 new audits this quarter" — creates scarcity
- Time commitment section is HUGE — "Your total time: ~3 hours" removes my biggest objection
- Mini case studies with industry variety (SaaS, DTC, Professional Services) — I see myself
- FAQ section addresses my exact questions (justifying cost, implementation capacity)
- "30 days of follow-up support" now clarified as "Slack/email access"

**Remaining concerns:**
- Would still want to see more specific SaaS case study
- The $5-10k range is still a mental hurdle, but the ROI framing helps

**What would make me NOT book:**
- If the call was clearly a hard sell
- If I couldn't get on his calendar quickly

**Verdict:** Much stronger. The time commitment clarity and FAQ section closed the deal for me.

- Believability: 8/10 (was 6)
- Urgency: 7/10 (was 5)
- Would I book a call? **Yes** (was No)

**What improved:**
- DTC brand case study! "Found 40% of tickets were 'where's my order?' — fixed with one integration" — that's literally my problem

- FAQ about "do you understand my industry" is directly addressed

**Remaining concerns:**

## Key Improvements That Worked

### 1. Time Commitment Clarity
Every page now explicitly states how much founder time is required. This was a universal concern and addressing it directly converted "maybes" to "yeses."

### 2. Industry-Specific Proof
Adding mini case studies with variety (SaaS, DTC, professional services for audit; different agency types for overhaul) made skeptical buyers feel seen.

### 3. Scarcity/Urgency Signals
"Taking 2 audits this quarter" / "1 spot available" / "Currently have capacity for 1 new engagement" added urgency without feeling desperate.

### 4. FAQ/Objection Sections
Preemptively answering the top objections (Can you keep up? What if my team resists? Do you understand my industry?) builds trust and saves the call for actual discovery.

### 5. "Won't Make You Corporate" Messaging
For agency page specifically, directly addressing the fear that "systems = bureaucracy" was crucial for creative founders.

### 6. Embedded/Scope Clarity (Fractional)
Defining what "embedded" means practically (Slack, weekly sync, tool access) removed ambiguity that was causing hesitation.

## Remaining Opportunities for Final Polish

1. **Ops Audit:** Could add one more SaaS-specific example
2. **Fractional Ops:** Consider adding consumer tech example if one exists
3. **Agency Overhaul:** Payment terms / cash flow flexibility could be mentioned
4. **All Pages:** Could add brief "How the call works" to further lower friction
5. **All Pages:** Consider adding founder photo/bio for human connection
